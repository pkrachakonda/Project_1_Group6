Property market is influenced by various factors, albeit to varying degrees and the market is Perth Western Australia is no exception. Some determinants hold greater sway than others, painting a complex picture of this real estate landscape. A spart of this study, authors have tried to understand the influence of number of rooms, property age, and land size, factors closely entwined with the proximity to the CBD, coastal regions, and the Swan River on the Property Prices.

Analysis of data related to property features such land area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms through statistically and analytical analysis, suggested that Property features have a strong correlation with the property’s value. Property values have increased by approximately 37 and 40% *(Slide 3 of presentation)*, when the number of bedrooms increased from 4 to 5 and 8 to 9 respectively. The above observation was also supported through a statistical linear analysis (Ordinary Least Square and Student’s T test as well as Linear regression analysis) of the data *(Slides 9-10 of presentation)*. 

School rankings, which command a substantial 45% of influence (Slide 6), as opposed to the 10% sway *(Slide 7of presentation)* attributed to the proximity of train stations near the Central Business District (CBD). Further insights emerge when examining geographical distinctions. Properties situated to the north of the river generally command higher prices compared to their counterparts situated further south and east of Perth *(Slide 8 of presentation)*.

A noteworthy historical insight reveals that during the World War II period (1940-1945), there was a scarcity of properties available for sale *(Slide 5 of presentation)*. This shortage can likely be attributed to the diversion of resources toward the war effort, leaving a noticeable gap in the housing market.

Statistical analysis has indicated that a strong relationship exists between distance of water bodies, such as rivers, beach as well as financial capacity of households and property *(Slides 10-11 of presentation)*.

It's essential to note, however, that this analysis does not encompass certain critical factors, such as security, building type, proximity to recreation facilities, and population concentration. Some outliers such as properties with wrong number of property features, wrong type of property labels, were observed during the data cleaning and analysis process. Household income profile were accurate of 2021 and for a Local Government Areas, which has resulted in grouping of all properties in that area as part of analysis. As part of assessing the impact of distance of water bodies on the dependent variable (property price), a subset of location of property were considered.

These unaccounted elements may possess a more pronounced impact on housing prices. As such, future studies should delve into these aspects to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics influencing housing prices in Perth.
